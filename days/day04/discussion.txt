what we have done with git and github? 
- git hub repo created with 
	readme file and of type public.
- cloned repo using visual studio code 
	where we used token to authenticate
- opened the cloned dir in vsc 
- changed the content of the readme file 
- we updated the changes to git 
	using add command (+ symbol under the changes category)
	then commited along with message 
	
	if first time, the git is used in the computer 
	we have to setup global config of user name and email
- we pushed the local repo to github 
	using sync command 
		sync cmd == pull + push
